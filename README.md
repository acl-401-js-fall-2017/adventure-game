GAME OBJECTIVE

This is an adventure game.  The basic goal is to help the gnome find the Golden Chalice of Antioch.  He will be faced with obstacles along the way, including impassable regions and a chalice-protecting ogre.

The gnome will have to traverse the fields and forest. Because he has no climbing gear, he cannot pass the mountains. There is also a river that the gnome will have to cross to be able to reach the chalice.  However, without a boat, he can only cross it by walking across the bridge.  This is not an easy task.  For one, he must first find the key that unlocks the bridge gate.  Secondly, he will encounter the ogre who is always watching the bridge for trespassers.  The gnome must be prepared to fight the ogre in order to cross the bridge but he may also run up against the ogre at any other random place in Antioch. The gnome can either battle the ogre immediately or he can try to run from the ogre.  However, if he is not fast enough, the gnome will be forced to battle an even more brutish ogre, now fueled by anger.
